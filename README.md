## TypeScript Helpers
Package currently includes TypeScript helpers, which are variables generated by TypeScript and used throughout the compiled code.
For example, `__extends` helper allows to change implementation (if overriden) of the class inheritance.
In general, they may be useful in certain use cases, one of them is compatibility with the old browsers.
