## TypeScript Helpers
Package currently includes TypeScript helpers, which are variables generated by TypeScript and used throughout the compiled code.
For example, `__extends` helper allows to change implementation (if overriden) of the class inheritance.
This package uses official `tslib` NPM to import helpers, and then exposes them globally.
